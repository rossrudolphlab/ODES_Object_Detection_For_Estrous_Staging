# ODES (Object Detection for Estrous Staging)

**ODES** is a machine learning tool that detects and classifies cell types to monitor the estrous cycle in female mice.

## Installation

These instructions only need to be followed once:

1. **Install Anaconda**

   Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

2. **Download ODES Files**

   Clone this repository or download the following files from the ODES folder:
   - `ODES.py`
   - `finalweight.pt`

3. **Create ODES Folder**

   Create a new folder on your desktop named **ODES** and place the downloaded files into it.

4. **Set Up Conda Environment**

   Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows) and execute the following commands:
   ```
   conda create --name odes
   conda activate odes
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   conda install numpy pillow opencv pandas
   conda install -c pytorch pytorch
   pip install ultralytics
   ```

## Usage

Follow these steps each time you want to use ODES:

1. **Prepare Image Folder**

   Place your image folder in the **ODES** folder on your desktop.

2. **Activate Conda Environment**

   Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows) and activate the odes environment:
   ```
   conda activate odes
   ```

3. **Navigate to ODES Folder**

   Navigate to the ODES folder:
   ```
   cd /path/to/ODES
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/ODES` with the full path to the ODES folder on your desktop (e.g. `/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/ODES` or `C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\ODES`).

4. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script:
   ```
   python ODES.py
   ```

5. **Provide Image Folder Path**

   When prompted, enter the path to your image folder:
   
   - If the image folder is in the ODES directory, just type the folder name.
   
   - Otherwise, provide the full path (e.g., `/Users/YourUsername/ImageFolder`).

7. **Choose Output Options**

   When prompted, decide whether to generate annotated images:
   
   - Type "yes" to generate annotated images and the script will create:
     
     - A `results.csv` file with all classifications.
       
     - A new folder called `annotated_images` containing the annotated images.
       
   - Type "no" to generate just the `results.csv` file with all classifications.

   Both output files will be saved in the **ODES** folder.

## Uninstallation

To remove the ODES environment and its dependencies:

1. **Open Terminal or Anaconda Prompt**

   Launch Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows).

2. **Remove Conda Environment**

   Execute the following command:
   ```
   conda remove --name odes --all
   ```

3. **Confirm Uninstallation**

   Confirm the action when prompted.

4. **Delete ODES Folder**

   Optionally, delete the **ODES** folder from your desktop to remove the script files.

## Image Preparation Recommendations

To achieve the best results with ODES, please ensure your images are prepared according to the following guidelines:

**Staining**: Ensure images are properly stained. Unstained images reduce the modelâ€™s ability to accurately distinguish cell boundaries and characteristics, as it relies on these features to identify and classify cells effectively.

**Cell Clumping**: Avoid images where cells are clumped together. ODES may struggle to classify cells accurately when they overlap or lack clear boundaries, which can complicate the detection of individual cell features.

**Cell Count**: Be aware that very low cell counts (<35) in images can make stage classification difficult.
By following these recommendations you can improve the accuracy and reliability of the results produced by ODES.
